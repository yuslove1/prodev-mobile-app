# prodev-mobile-app: React Native Mobile App Development with Expo Router

This project provides a hands-on learning experience in React Native development. Each directory (0x04, 0x05, 0x06) represents a milestone building upon the previous one.  This structured approach allows for incremental learning and development of a progressively more functional mobile application.

## Milestones/Exercises


* **0x04-stack-navigation (Milestone 0):** Introduces navigation using the Stack Navigation pattern. This milestone lays the foundation for navigating between screens in a hierarchical manner.

* **0x05-tab-navigation (Milestone 1):** Builds upon Milestone 0 by implementing Tab Navigation with Expo Router.  This enhances the navigation structure, allowing users to switch between different sections of the app using tabs.

* **0x06-styling-with-nativewind (Milestone 2):** Integrates Tailwind CSS with NativeWind, allowing for rapid and efficient styling using utility classes. This milestone focuses on improving the app's visual appearance and styling consistency.


## Key Technologies and Concepts

* **React Native:** The core framework for building cross-platform mobile apps.
* **Expo:**  A suite of tools and services simplifying React Native development.
* **Expo Router:**  The navigation solution used for managing app navigation.
* **Stack Navigation:**  A hierarchical navigation pattern.
* **Tab Navigation:**  A navigation pattern for organizing app content into tabs.
* **Tailwind CSS:**  A utility-first CSS framework.
* **NativeWind:** A library bridging Tailwind CSS to React Native.


## Getting Started

Each milestone directory (0x04, 0x05, 0x06) contains specific instructions in its README.  Follow the instructions in each directory sequentially to build the app.  It's crucial to complete the milestones in order as they build upon each other. For example, complete 0x04 before starting 0x05, and 0x05 before 0x06.
